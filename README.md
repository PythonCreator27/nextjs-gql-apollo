# Next.js GraphQL Todos App

This is a next.js todosa app using GraphQL. Some technologies used:

-   Apollo Client
-   TypeScript

-   Formik

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Backend

This app uses [this project](https://PythonCreator27/apollo-gql-api) as the backend. Clone that repo, run `yarn build`, and run `yarn start` to start the server. If you want to use a custom backend, set the API_URL value in `.env`.
